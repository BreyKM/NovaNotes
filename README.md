<hr>
<h3>A minimalist markdown editor built with Electron, Svelte, and Tailwind CSS. My goal was to build a distraction-free, cross-platform desktop application that prioritizes a local-first workflow and a seamless writing experience. 
  Throughout the development process, I faced challenges such as getting the tabs, the sidebar, and the main editor to all stay in sync, verifying directory accessibility, and building a robust auto-save feature.</h3>
